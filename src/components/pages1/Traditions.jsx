            <h2 className="traditions-h2">The Epic of Manas</h2>
            <p className="traditions-para">The Epic of Manas is a great masterpiece of folklore of  Kyrgyz people. It is the longest epic poem in the world. In one of its iterations it consists of more than 500 000 lines. In 1995 people of Kyrgyzstan celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of the Epic of Manas.

Throughout the ages the Epic of Manas went the round, enriching and getting new shades, but keeping a clear storyline.

            <h2 className="traditions-h2">Nomadic Life</h2>
            <p className="traditions-para">At all times the main occupation of Kyrgyz people was cattle breeding. They bred mostly sheep, horses, yaks and camels. To provide cattle with grazing they had to roam from one place to another. In summer nomads ascend to alpine summer pastures “jailoo”. When winter came went down into the valley, on the winter pastures “kyshtoo”.

Roaming to jailoo has always been a significant holiday for Kyrgyz people. They put on festive, fine clothing and led caravans to a new place. Camels and horses were covered with beautiful colored carpets with bright patterns. The most beautiful girl in expensive jewelry rode in front of the caravan. If the caravan route lay through any settlement, its residents greeted the nomads with great hospitality, offered some refreshments to them and wished a happy journey. The family that roamed into the jailoo first, traditionally cooked meals for the following families.

In autumn, when roaming back, Kyrgyz people ran some magic rites to return there the following season. To the pit of the pegs, to which foals were tied, nomads poured ayran or kumys to ingratiate spirits.

Nomads looked after their cattle very carefully. During the day only men were traditionally involved in the process of graze. At night this function was passed to young women. Looking after their livestock, they sang a special song (“bekbekey”), which scared off predators and evil spirits away from the flock. The birth of a calf, lamb, camel or colt had always been a great joy for the owner.

Another important occupation of nomadic people was hunting. Adroit hunters had a lot of special tools for moving in the highlands. They hunted mainly for wolves, deer, mountain goats. Hunters actively used hunting birds such as eagles, falcons and hawks. Kyrgyz hunters also used dogs of a special breed Taigans for battues.</p>

            <h2 className="traditions-h2">Traditional Clothes</h2>
            <p className="traditions-para">Features of the nomadic lifestyle of Kyrgyz people have been reflected in their national clothes. First, the clothes had to be light and comfortable, so that a nomad could comfortably ride on horseback. Second, the clothes had to be strong, but uncomplicated, so that it could be home-made. Third, it must reliably protect people from the cold, that is important in a mountain climate. The main materials for making clothes were coarse wool, felt, fur and leather. The noble families could afford expensive clothes made of fabrics from the towns of the Great Silk Road.

The outerwear is called “chapan”. The chapan is a kind of padded coat made of a strong and warm woolen fabric, with buttons and high collar. In winter nomads wore sheepskin coat named “ton” and fur coats “ichiks” made ​​of fox fur, wolf or lynx. The main traditional shoes are boots decorated with colorful ornaments, with long tops and narrow toes.

Men wore wide trousers made ​​of leather or suede, embroidered with colored threads (“chalbar”, “kandagay”), shirts (“keynek”) and felt robe (“kementay”). Noble and rich people wore jewelry. A male attribute of wealth in the clothing was a wide leather belt (kemer), decorated with various silver incuts.

The traditional women's clothing consisted of long white shirts or dresses (“keynek”) and long pantaloons. Young women wore sleeveless jackets of colored velvet (“chyptama”). Married women wore skirts with fur and patterned embroidery (“beldemchi”).

Headwear always played a special role in Kyrgyz traditional clothing. Ak kalpak is a white felt hat worn by men. It is one of the important symbols of Kyrgyz people. The hat in the shape of a turban made of fine white muslin is called “elechek”. Traditionally it is worn by married women.</p>

            <h2 className="traditions-h2">National Food</h2>
            <p className="traditions-para">National cuisine in Kyrgyzstan is especially rich and diverse. It has been developed throughout the history of Kyrgyz people and collected the most delicious dishes and beverages from the period of nomadic life, and dishes of neighboring nations in the region as well.

As the nomadic lifestyle required a lot of strength and energy, the national dishes of Kyrgyz people had extraordinary nutritional and caloric content. Their main ingredients were meat, milk, flour and cereals.

Most traditional dishes don’t do without meat. Kyrgyz people like to eat lamb, beef, yak meat, and especially horse meat. The most famous dish is the Kyrgyz beshbarmak. It is boiled chopped lamb with onions and noodles, poured with broth. The name of this dish is translated from Kyrgyz as "five fingers", and it is traditionally eaten with the fingers. The traditional soup “shorpo” is also popular among peopole. This is a hot broth with chunks of meat, potatoes, carrots and greens. The dish of fried meat is called “kuurdak”: meat (lamb, beef or horse meat) is being cut into large pieces and fried with onions on the fat of tail. Horse meat sausage “chuchuk” and sausage from the liver and blood with spices “byzhy” are considered as real delicacy.

Dairy products also are an integral part of Kyrgyz people’s meals. They like to drink ayran, very thick fermented beverage made from sheep's milk. The key to good health and longevity has always been drinking of “kumys”, an extremely beneficial drink of fermented mare's milk prepared on the jailoo in summer. Traditional types of cheese “syuzmo” and “kurut” (solid small white balls with a salty taste) are also made from milk. Syuzmo can be diluted with water, then you’ll get the best thirst-quenching beverage “chalap”.

Traditional beverages are also made from millet and barley. Bozo is a national drink, similar to beer, which is made from millet, wheat or corn.  Particularly popular summer drinks “djarma” and “maksym” are made from barley flour “talkan” in the process of fermentation.

No dinner is complete without bread. Usually it is round-shaped. It is baked in a cauldron (“kemkerme tokoch”), in a frying pan (“kemechten”) or in oven (“tandyr-nan”). On holidays people cook a special regale “boorsok”, fried sweet pieces of dough.

Every meal is accompanied by a cup of tea. People drink black and green tea, with milk, cream or melted butter. After a long journey tea perfectly quenches thirst, and after receiving high-calorie fatty foods tea is a real lifesaver for the body. Tea is usually drunk from a special bows pialas.

Its also common for Kyrgyz families to cook dishes borrowed from other nations. These dishes refer to Dungan and Uighur cuisine. They are ashlyam fu and lagman (noodles with spicy sauce, meat and vegetables), manti and chuchvara (boiled dough stuffed with minced meat). Pilaf (a dish of rice, carrots and meat) came from Uzbek cuisine. It is usually cooked for holidays and festivities.</p>

            <p className="traditions-para">Moving from one place to another is inherent in nomadic way of life. Therefore, it is important to have a dwelling that is easy to assemble, disassemble and carry on pack animals. Yurt became such dwelling for Kyrgyz people.

The basis of the wooden frame of a yurt is composed of several elements. The setting of a yurt begins with the doorway “bosogo”, usually facing south or south-east. The walls are a grid of birch poles called “kerege”.  The base of a dome is also assembled of poles called “uuk”, then goes a rim called “tyundyuk”. Tyundyuk is used for entry of sunlight into the yurt as well as for going out of smoke. Tyundyuk is one of the most recognizable symbols of Kyrgyzstan, which is represented on the flag of the country. Outside yurt is covered with woven straw called “chiy” and thick felt “kiyiz”. The doorway is also covered with felt, or there stand double doors instead.

In the center of the yurt there is a hearth called “kolomto”. The back of the yurt is called “dzhyuk”. There you can usually see chests and folded blankets, pillows and carpets. Between kolomto and dzhyuk there is the place of honor called “ter”, where sits the head of the family or the most distinguished guests.

The right side of the yurt (“epchi jak”) is the female half, which holds stocks of food, dishes, various items needed in the household. The left side of the yurt is called “er jak”, the male half. There are a saddle, harness, weapons, animal skins. The floor and walls of a yurt are decorated with beautiful patterned rugs called “shyrdaks”.</p>

            <h2 className="traditions-h2">Music</h2>
            <p className="traditions-para">Since ancient time music played an important role in the life of Kyrgyz people. Any holiday in the village did not do without music, and young and old people gathered to listen to wonderful tunes of master musicians. Kyrgyz people, like any nation, have their traditional musical instruments, reflecting the unique national character.

The most widely used instrument is komuz. It is made by skilled craftsmen from a single piece of wood (usually juniper, apricot or walnut). Its length does not exceed 80-90 cm. Komuz has three strings. It is usually played while sitting: A musician is keeping the instrument in a horizontal position, the left hand is holding the strings on the neck, and fingers of the right hand are running over them. Komuz can be tuned up in different ways. Musicians can play cheerful and sonorous melodies and lyrical motives, taking the soul as well.

Another well-known musical symbol of Kyrgyz people is temir-komuz, an oral stringed musical instrument of arched shape. The fact that it is made of metal reflects its title (temir in translation from Kyrgyz menas “iron”). The sound emitted by this musical instrument is unusual, but it is very soft and charming. Women and children often play the temir-komuz.

Kyl-kyak is a bow musical instrument with two strings. It is made of juniper or apricot tree wood, strings and bow are made of the finest horse hair. Musicians play on kyl-kyak, holding it upright on the lap and moving the bow. The sound of this music is quite specific. It’s hollow, but in some ways resembles the tone of the human voice.

Chopo-chor is a kind of wind instrument made ​​of clay. It was popular mainly in the southern agricultural regions of the country. It is an elongated tube with openings which are periodically covered with fingers during the process of playing it.

National drum is called dobulbash. It has a diameter of about 30 cm, and covered with camel skin on the top. It gives very sonorous rhythmic sound that can be helpfull during military campaigns or magic rituals.

As you can see, all national instruments are made of materials and items that are available in a nomadic household. This gives musical instruments unique flavor and spirit of nomadic freedom.</p>

The extraordinary sights are also such games as oodarysh (a struggle between two riders on horseback), tyiyn enmey (raising skill coin from the ground at full gallop), and jamby atmai (shooting a gun at a target at full gallop).

A favorite competition of athletes has always been a kind of belt wrestling kyuresh. Its main purpose is to make an opponent fall down without removing the hands from his belt. Both adults and children like play alchiks (“ordo”).
